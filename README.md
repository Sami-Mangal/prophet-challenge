# Introduction

This notebook demonstrates how to use the Prophet library to forecast future values of a time series. Prophet is an open-source tool developed by Facebook for producing high-quality forecasts for time series data that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.

# Requirements

To run this notebook, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- prophet (formerly fbprophet)
- jupyter


```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib prophet jupyter
```

# Data Preparation

In this section, the notebook loads the time series data and performs necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, aggregating data, and creating new features required for the forecasting model.

# Model Training

This section covers how to initialize and train the Prophet model using the prepared dataset. The model's hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the forecasting performance.

# Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and others. The evaluation process helps in understanding the model's accuracy and reliability.

# Results Visualization

Here, the notebook visualizes the forecast results, including the predicted values and their confidence intervals. The visualizations help in interpreting the model's performance and the forecasted trends.

# Usage

To use this notebook:

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
4. Follow the instructions provided in each section to understand and execute the code.

# Acknowledgments

The Prophet library was developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team. More information can be found on GitHub.
